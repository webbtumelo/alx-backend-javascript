The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

A Promise is in one of these states:

pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
